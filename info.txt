    | Open the folder you just created on your desktop.

5.  Click on Terminal drop down menu and choose New Terminal.
    | If not already, cd into the working folder, direct the terminal to the current folder that you opened up with VSCode
    | Type in your terminal:   git init    [press enter] (This will create a .git folder which will be used to communicate your local files and github)

6.  Begin making webpages/code on VSCode (HTML, CSS, JavaScript ......)
    | Don't forget to save your work?

7.  Terminal:     git status    [press enter] (This will show the files that have been added or modified)

8.  Terminal:     git add .     [press enter] (This will prepare the files that you want to upload to Github)

12.  Terminal:    git push -u origin main (master) [press enter]   (This will push all your local files to github.)
    | Note:  Github projects main repository used to be called master.  Because of events in the USA (BLM) it was deemed that master was not an appropriate term to use. So, when working on older projects be sure when uploading to github that you use;
    git push (or pull) -u origin main or master depending on the github file setup.

====== WORKING WITH GITHUB AND LOCAL PROJECT ======

1.  Open VSCode and open the folder of the project that your are working on through VSCode.
2.  Begin writing code to your project and save (save often).
3.  Open terminal through VSCode.
4.  Make sure terminal is directed to the folder/project that your are currently working on.
5.  Terminal:   git status
6.  Terminal:   git add .
7.  Terminal:   git status
8.  Terminal:   git commit -m "Message goes here"
9.  Terminal:   git push        
    | (Note:  Since we did git push -u remote origin main once on this project we only have to use git push command from now on.  If we create a new branch then we would have to git push -u remote origin branchname but again just the first time.  Afterwards it would be just git push.)


====== BRANCHING =====

1.  Branching is like a side job that you work on for the main project.  You work with the main project code without affecting the main project.  It is like testing before implementing to the final project.
2.  To create a new branch:  Open VSCode to your project and open terminal.
    | Terminal: git status
    | Terminal: git checkout -b branchname
        | example =>    git checkout -b tips_tricks
    | Terminal: git branch (this will show you what your current branch is)
    | Terminal: git checkout main (This will switch you back to the main (master) branch)
3.  If you already have a branch that you have used before:
    | Terminal: git checkout branchname
        | example =>    git checkout tips_tricks
    | Terminal: git branch (to confirm which working branch you are currenly on)
